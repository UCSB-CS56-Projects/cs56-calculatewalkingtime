W16 FINAL REMARKS:
So as it is right now, we've factored the code that does all GUI animation in MapGui, and all calculations are taken care of in UCSBWalk. We made a class BuildCheckBox that extends JCheckbox and added a data member, Name for the name of the building that the box corresponds to. In addition, only 15 of the buildings on the UCSB campus are represented in the program.
